# Nolan

Nolan's personal organizer. Today it covers the 2026/27 year at UC3M (Double Degree in Computer Engineering and Business Administration).
A static site (HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no libraries, no build step) published on GitHub Pages:
<https://relentlessyunn.github.io/with-nolan/>

> **For Claude:** read this whole file before touching anything. Clone the repo
> (`git clone https://github.com/RelentlessYunn/with-nolan`) to work on the

> (see *Publishing a version*) and run the tests (they run without the PIN:
> never ask for it, type it or try to guess it; see *Tests*). Answer the owner

## PIN and guest mode

The site opens behind an entry screen (`js/gate.js`, styles in `css/cinema.css`). At first it shows only Nolan's logo and, in the middle, a **Guest** button (*Invitado*).

- **The logo opens the PIN keypad** (`#gateLogo` opens `#gatePad`). Typing a digit on a keyboard opens it too. The logo again, or Escape, closes it and clears what was typed.
- The PIN is **not** in the code: only its PBKDF2-SHA256 hash (150 000 rounds, fixed salt), in `js/gate.js` and in the `<head>` script of `index.html`.
- A device that types the right PIN stores that hash in `localStorage` (`nolan-device`) and is never asked again. Clearing the browser's data, or a private window, asks again.
- **Nothing of yours is read before the PIN**: the cloud is read only once the gate opens (`Gate.onOpen` in `cloud.js`; this device's saved copy of it is shown only then too), and the location is asked only then.
- **Guest** (`#gateGuest`): the camera flies in as after the PIN, but a guest sees only the universe:
  - **can see**: home's first screen (the time, a greeting for the guest such as "Buenas tardes, invitado", the weather), the sights, Settings and just the sky;
  - **cannot see**: the UC3M and Nolan cards, Notes, or any page of the app (header, tabs and pages are hidden; `router.js` sends every other address to `#home`, and Escape on home goes nowhere);
  - nothing is read from the cloud, and the location is never asked: the weather is Getafe's, and it is not saved on the device.
  - It lasts this visit only (`sessionStorage`, key `nolan-guest`). The `<head>` script of `index.html` marks `<html data-guest>` before painting, and the css hides the rest (`cinema.css`). A device that knows the PIN is never a guest. In code: `Gate.guest()`; the Guest button calls `Router.route()` first, so an address of the app (say `#tasks`) lands on home.
- **Leaving guest mode**: Settings, red button ("Salir del modo invitado"): back to the entry screen. It is the same `Gate.lock()` as Log out, which also forgets the guest visit. Closing the tab ends it too.
- **To change the PIN**: compute the new hash (`node -e 'console.log(require("crypto").pbkdf2Sync("NEWPIN","nolan·with-nolan·2026",150000,32,"sha256").toString("hex"))'`) and replace it in both places, and in `DEVICE` in `tests/run.js`. Every device will ask again.
- **Limits:** this keeps people out of the page, but the repository is public: anyone who opens the code on GitHub can read `data.js` and the rest. Guest mode hides the data in the page, not in the repository. A six-digit PIN can also be brute-forced offline from the hash. Real protection would need private hosting with a login in front (for example Cloudflare Access).

## The universe

The whole app is one universe in real 3D, drawn by the graphics card (WebGL2) on a canvas behind everything (`js/universe.js`).

- **Home is the Nolan galaxy.** After the PIN (or Guest) the camera flies from deep space, from behind the Earth, into home (about five and a half seconds, the far stars fading in around you) and stays there. Home's own galaxy is the blue spiral high on the right of its sky.
- **Each section is a galaxy you can see from home**: UC3M (the golden barred spiral low on the left) and Nolan (under construction, the amber elliptical high on the left).
- **Opening a section** flies the camera into its galaxy (`Home.enter(id, go)` → `Universe.go(id)`), and the section appears inside it: UC3M's timetable has UC3M's galaxy glowing over the header. **A second click** (or Enter / Space) during the trip shows the section at once while the camera flies on to the end, so the sky never jumps (`Universe.skip()`). **Going home** flies back out.
- **A flight takes the time its way needs**: `Universe.go` times it by its length (`flightTime`: 2.2 s plus a little per unit of distance, at most 4.8 s; back to the Earth, far behind home, nearly five), unless it is given a duration (the flight after the PIN: 5.6 s; the opening from the Earth: 4.2 s). The last frame of a flight is always drawn, so the screen never stays on where it came from.
- **The sights**: places the camera flies to and frames whole, one by one: the **Earth**, the **Moon**, the **black hole**, the **Whirlpool** (home's own galaxy), the **ring galaxy**, the **edge-on galaxy**, the **Orion Nebula**, the **Pleiades**, the **Ring Nebula**, the **vampire star** (the red giant feeding a white dwarf) and the **Antennae**. Routes `#earth`, `#moon`, `#blackhole`, `#whirlpool`, `#ringgalaxy`, `#edgeon`, `#orion`, `#pleiades`, `#ring`, `#binary`, `#antennae` (see *Home* for their pages).
  - `PLACES` in `universe.js` says where each one is and how big it looks (`p`, `R` in world units, `k` for a closer or wider look, and `turn` for a galaxy, see below). `layout()` fills it: the black hole with its whole disk, the galaxies of `SIGHT_GALAXIES` (`whirlpool`, `ringgalaxy`, `edgeon`: which galaxy, and how much of it to frame; the edge-on one as wide as its whole disk), and each wonder as big as it is drawn (the `sights` it declares in `wonders.js`).
  - `sightView()` places the camera so the sight's radius fills a set share of the screen's shorter side (40% on a narrow screen, a phone; 29% on a computer; 22% on a short one, a phone on its side; times `k`), with its centre a little above the middle so its words fit below. The camera looks the way home's camera looks, so each sight is seen as it was designed to be seen from home; for a galaxy, part of the way along home's line of sight to it (`turn`).
  - `Universe.sights()` lists their names; `Universe.place(id)` says where one is on the screen and how big it looks (tests).
- **Effects = Medium: a sky of stars you can fly through** (`window.Stars`, in `sky.js`). No 3D: each place is one still picture of stars, painted once. On home each section (and the black hole) is a bright coloured star where its galaxy would be; opening it moves smoothly forward into that star, into the section's own sky, its star shining where it was — one move of about a second, quicker than the 3D flight, with no pull-back and no flare; the two skies cross by adding their light, and a sky drawn smaller than the screen repeats around itself, so the screen is never left without stars. Going home moves back out. `Universe.go` hands its flights to `Stars` when there is no 3D universe. The sights need the 3D universe: without it their list on home is hidden (`html.nogl`), and a sight's address stays in home's sky (only `#blackhole` flies into its own star).
- **Nothing is recalculated frame by frame on the processor.** Every moving thing is an exact formula of time evaluated by the graphics card; each frame the page only passes the time and the camera. Galaxy stars and maps are built once, one galaxy at a time (home's first), in small steps so the page never stutters: the stars are worked out in a background worker, and each disk's map is painted on the graphics card in strips of about 512×512 pixels, one per turn (one big paint used to hold the graphics card for ~40 ms).
- **One loop draws everything**, and only while something needs it (`loop()`, which runs `oneFrame()`). `need()` asks for one more frame; asked while a frame is being drawn (a supernova, a wonder fading in), it is that same loop that asks for the next one. It used to start another loop each time, so two loops ran every frame, then four, then eight.
- **Spiral galaxies follow the density-wave model** (Lin & Shu, as in Ingo Berg's *Galaxy Renderer*): every star moves on an ellipse, each ellipse a little flatter and a little more turned the further out it is. The arms are where the ellipses crowd together, so they stay while the stars flow through them, and inner stars turn faster than outer ones. The whole pattern turns slowly too.
  - **Pink star-forming regions** only light up while they cross an arm (where neighbouring orbits squeeze together) and fade as they leave it; young blue stars and clouds of them live in the arms and fade between them.
  - **Resolved stars**: most are faint grain, a few are bright giants (a steep luminosity function), each at its own height above or below the disk, so they drift against the disk when the camera turns.
  - **Bulges** are swarms of stars on orbits in every direction; **globular clusters** (tight balls of old stars) circle each galaxy on their own tilted orbits; the Whirlpool has its small yellow companion (NGC 5195) and the ring galaxy two small ones (`COMPANIONS`).
- **Each disk is a real volume**, not a picture. Its light (old stars, young stars in clouds, pink regions) and its dust are painted once as a map on the graphics card, from the same orbits (plus patchiness and dust filaments), and the 3D noise for the dust clouds is made once too (only its three small grids of random values go to the graphics card, which blends them itself: a big cube of finished noise, read all over by the rays, was most of the cost of a frame). The page then walks every ray through the disk, front to back: old stars fill a thick layer that flares towards the edge, young stars and pink regions a thin one, and the dust forms clouds with a real 3D shape (made from the noise cube) that rise out of the middle plane and dip into it, brownish at their thin edges. Samples crowd where the ray is nearest the middle plane, where the light and the dust are. The dust darkens what lies behind it, so dust lanes cross the near side of a bulge. Bulges and the elliptical are real 3D glows (brightest at the centre, sampled densely there), and every galaxy sits in a faint round **stellar halo**, so it glows into space instead of looking cut out.
- **The far sky**: thousands of stars fixed on the sky (a few twinkle slowly), a faint nebula painted once, dozens of tiny far galaxies (each drawn from a formula), and stars scattered through space that stretch into streaks while the camera flies. Galaxies away from the centre of the screen are turned to face home's camera, so they look as intended from home and reveal their depth when you fly to them.
- **A black hole** (`SIGHTS.bh` in `universe.js`), in home's sky and one of the sights (`#blackhole`): the camera flies straight up to it and the hole fills the sky above its words. It is **ray-traced**, not painted, in the last step of each frame: for every pixel near it the ray of light is followed backwards along its real path in the curved space around the hole (Schwarzschild; the step of Riccardo Antonelli's *Starless*: a = −1.5·h²·p/|p|⁵), and shows whatever that path meets — the hole, the thin disk of hot gas each time it crosses it, or the sky it escapes to. The shadow, the thin ring of light that went round it, the disk bent over the top and under the bottom and the Einstein ring of whatever lies behind (galaxies are bent into arcs) all come out of that. The gas glows like a black body at the thin disk's temperature (inner edge at the last stable orbit), bluer and brighter on the side coming at us and redder going away (Doppler), dimmer and redder deep in the pull (gravitational redshift); its clumps and streaks turn with it, the inside faster than the outside, in three rings of pattern blended by radius, so it never winds itself up or starts over. Farther out the bending is small and is done as a point lens. The disk leans against a fixed axis, so it is seen from above both from home and up close. **When it is only a few pixels wide** (far away, seen from the Earth or the Moon) it fades out: it is traced over everything, so a speck of it would show through whatever stands in front.
- **The band of our galaxy** across the sky, like the Milky Way on a dark night: painted once (`BANDGEN_FS`), on a computer a low arch behind the interface (seen on both sides and under the clock), on a phone a long diagonal (`bandShape()`). Star clouds made of countless faint stars, a brighter heart, winding lanes and clouds of dust (drawn in a second pass that hides the far stars behind them), pink knots of gas, blue haze and faint wisps reaching out of its edges; thousands more faint stars crowd along it. The nebulae sit inside it and the galaxies around it, as in the real sky.
- **Other wonders** (`js/wonders.js`), each drawn from a formula by the graphics card, in its place in space (so flights and the slow turn move them like everything else), all visible from home and each one a sight: the **Orion Nebula** (pink hydrogen lit by the four Trapezium stars, a veil of dust filaments); the **Pleiades** (nine blue-white stars at their real places, with spikes, in fine streaks of blue reflection nebula, and a hundred fainter members scattered around them); the **Ring Nebula** (teal inside, red rim, the white dwarf in the middle); a **red giant feeding a white dwarf** (the giant round all over but drawn out to a point towards its companion, a stream of gas curving from that point onto a disk, the two orbiting in 70 s and hiding each other); the **Antennae** (two galaxies colliding: merging cores, dust lanes, pink knots of newborn stars, and two long curved tidal tails). **A wonder fades in** (about a second and a half, `api.appear`) once its program is ready, instead of popping into the sky.
- **Now and then, a supernova**: every 3–9 minutes while the universe is alive, a star in a far galaxy flares in a second, blue-white with diffraction spikes, then over about a minute fades, turns yellow and red, and leaves a small ragged shell of glowing gas. `Wonders.nova(x, y, age)` sets one off (tests).
- **The opening starts at the Earth**: the first time the app opens in a session (Animations = All), the camera starts beside the Earth and the Moon and flies home. Both sit far behind home, so going back to them (the sights `#earth` and `#moon`) is flying back the way the opening came.
  - **The Earth** turns, its day side with oceans, coasts, forest, desert, ice and moving clouds, the Sun's small reflection on the sea, reddened light along the line between day and night; its night side dark with city lights (towns thicker on the coasts, joined by roads), green and crimson auroras over the poles, and its thin blue air glowing at the edge.
  - **The Moon** beside it is lit in its **real phase for today** (`Astro.moon`), and lit like the real Moon: nearly as bright at its edge as in its middle (Lommel–Seeliger), not like a matte ball, with a faint earthshine on its dark side. Dark seas of old lava with soft ragged shores; craters at three sizes (bowls with raised rims that catch or lose the sunlight), fewer on the seas; a few young bright ones; and the rays of two young craters where Tycho and Copernicus are.
  - The farther of the two is drawn first, so the nearer one covers it where they meet on the screen.
- **Meteor showers on their real dates** (`Astro.shower`, after the IMO calendar: Quadrantids, Lyrids, η-Aquariids, Perseids, Draconids, Orionids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids): around each peak there are more shooting stars, and many of them start near the shower's radiant and fly outwards from it.
- **Shooting stars and comets**: a shooting star every few seconds (now and then two together), starting anywhere and crossing in any direction: a hot blue-green head with a soft halo and a tapering tail that cools to orange, glows and flickers, and flares a little before it dies. Comets cross the screen from one side to the other, nearly level: they come in over one edge (tail and all) and leave over the other, bright all the way, often two or three at once; most drift across in about a minute, some shoot across in ten or fifteen seconds. Six kinds, after real ones (`COMET_KINDS`), and never two of the same kind at once: a great comet (curved dust tail and straight blue ion tail), an ion comet (a long blue tail split into streamers), a dusty golden comet (a wide curved fan), a small green comet (green coma, short faint tails), a comet breaking up into pieces, and a sungrazer with a very long bright tail. They live in space, nearer than the galaxies, so when the camera flies they grow, slide and pass by like everything else. Their tails always trail behind them along their path, turned a few degrees at most, the dust tail curving gently to that side: a soft fan that widens and dims as it spreads, brightest just behind the head, and a thin straight blue ion tail with soft knots drifting out along it. The comet grows and brightens as it passes closest and the coma breathes. Shooting stars glow up and fade away softly. Only with Animations = All.
- **Like a camera**: light is added up in high dynamic range and developed with a soft curve, a faint glow around bright things (bloom), a vignette and a fine dither against banding.
- **The universe is alive** (Animations = All and Quality = High): stars orbit, arms turn, the camera floats gently and slowly **turns around what it looks at** (at home around a point among the galaxies, in a section around its galaxy, which stays in the same place on the screen, at a sight around it), so every galaxy is seen from changing angles and near things move against far ones: that is what makes the depth visible. With a mouse the view also leans a little towards the pointer. The turn fades out during flights and back in on arrival. While you scroll the sky holds still, so every frame goes to the scrolling (flights aside); it also pauses when the tab is hidden and after 45 s without touching anything; then nothing is drawn at all. `Universe.seek(seconds)` jumps that time forward and `Universe.shoot()` sends a shooting star and a comet (tests).
- **Budget**: phones draw about a third of the stars, smaller maps and at about 30 frames a second; computers about 60 (every frame of a 60 Hz screen, every other one of a faster screen; flights, shooting stars and comets every frame). Each galaxy's volume (its soft light and dust, the costliest part of a frame) is drawn at half the resolution and spread over the full picture; the stars stay sharp (about 40% less per frame, the same picture within 1/255). The render size adapts within a second or two if the device cannot keep up. Automated tests use a tiny budget (`?tier=phone` or `?tier=desk` forces one).
- Every galaxy has its own shape in `GALAXIES`, after beautiful real ones:
  - **Nolan (home)**: a blue **grand-design spiral** seen nearly face-on, high on the right (like the Whirlpool, M51: tightly wound arms full of pink knots, and a small yellow companion, NGC 5195). It turns visibly while you look, and it is also a sight of its own (`#whirlpool`).
  - **UC3M**: a golden **barred spiral**, low on the left (like NGC 1300: a straight bar of old stars, made by long aligned inner orbits and a cigar-shaped bulge, with two open arms). Lively too: it turns while you look.
  - **Nolan in construction** (`forge`): an amber **elliptical**.
  - **The ring galaxy** (`ringgalaxy`, like Hoag's Object): a round yellow core, a dark gap and a nearly perfect ring of young blue stars, with two small companions; and **the edge-on galaxy** (`edgeon`, like M104): a big bright bulge cut by its dark ring of dust. They were the "to explore" galaxies (once named Andrómeda and Sombrero); now they are sights, with no section and no name of their own.
  - `Universe.view(id)` says where a galaxy sits on the screen (tests).
- Without WebGL2 there is no 3D universe: `js/sky.js` draws a simpler sky with CSS layers instead.
- **To add a section** (a checklist, so nothing is forgotten):
  1. its galaxy in `GALAXIES` (`universe.js`): kind and shape, size, angle, colours, where it sits seen from home (`at.d` computer, `at.m` phone), and `star`, the colour of its bright star in the sky of stars (Effects = Medium) — `sky.js` reads it from there;
  2. a card on home (`index.html`, inside `.p-cards`) with `data-scene="<id>"` (its galaxy), and its texts in both languages (`i18n.js`);
  3. its page: a route in `router.js` (`isHome` if it opens inside home) and its view (`home.js`, `sceneOf`);
  4. a guest must not see it if it shows any data: `.p-cards` is hidden for a guest, and `router.js` sends a guest home from every route except home, Settings and the sights;
  5. a test in `tests/run.js` that opening it flies into its galaxy, and the list of galaxies in the Astral test (`nolan,uc3m,forge`, three painted, four built with the companion) brought up to date.
- **To add a sight** (a checklist too):
  1. where it is and how big it looks:
     - a wonder made with `skyWonder` (`wonders.js`): give it `sight:"<id>"` and `vis`, how much of its square it really fills (so the camera frames what shows, not the empty corners);
     - a wonder with its own code: a list `sights:[{id, p, R, k}]` (where, how big in world units, and `k`: above 1 a closer look, below 1 a wider one);
     - a galaxy: an entry in `SIGHT_GALAXIES` (`universe.js`).
     `layout()` puts it in `PLACES` and `sightView()` frames it: nothing else to place by hand;
  2. its words in both languages (`i18n.js`): `sight.<id>.name`, `sight.<id>.tag` (on its card), `sight.<id>.fact` (the line above its name) and `sight.<id>.text` (a few words below it);
  3. its entry in `SIGHTS` (`home.js`), in the place it should have in the list and in the arrows: `id`, `ac` (its colour) and `icon` (a small SVG, viewBox 48×48). The card, the page, the route `#<id>` and the arrow keys follow by themselves. The `id` must be the same in all three places;
  4. the tests (`tests/run.js`): the sights test goes through `Home.sights()` by itself, so a new sight is flown to and checked on all four screens with nothing to add; only the number of sights in the home test (eleven now) must change.
- **Just the sky**: the eye button (on home and in UC3M's header) hides the whole interface and leaves the universe on the screen; Nolan's logo at the bottom or Escape brings it back (`js/view.js`). The button fades to almost nothing when left alone, and while you look the sky never goes to sleep. Not shown with Effects = Minimal.
- **Notes and Settings belong to every section**: their buttons are in UC3M's header and on home, they open where you are without moving the camera, and the back button (Nolan's logo, big and on its own, as on every page that goes back) takes you back there.
- **The logo is the home button** (top left in UC3M).
- The opening of home (the N drawing itself, NOLAN appearing) plays after the PIN (or Guest) and when the app starts.
- **Log out** (Settings, red button): `Gate.lock()` forgets the device, puts the camera back in deep space and returns to the entry screen, so the next PIN lands at home. For a guest the same button reads "Salir del modo invitado" and does the same.
- With Animations = Basic or None there are no flights (the camera jumps) and the universe stands still. Quality = Medium has no 3D universe: the sky of stars of `js/sky.js` (see above). Quality = Low has no universe at all: a plain dark background.

## Home

Home (`#home`, `js/home.js`, `css/home.css`) is a window on top of everything: the page behind cannot be clicked or tabbed into.

- **The first screen is the hero alone**: Nolan's logo, NOLAN, the time, the greeting and the sky outside (the weather), filling the screen. A small arrow at its foot (`#homeMore`) says there is more below: it scrolls down to the list, and fades once you scroll.
- **Further down**, where to go:
  - "¿A dónde vamos?": the **section cards**, UC3M (the week, the class now or next, the next assessment) and Nolan;
  - "Explora el universo": the **sights**, a card each (`#homeSights`, written by `home.js` from `SIGHTS`): its icon and colour, its name and a few words (the Moon's follow its phase tonight). Hidden without the 3D universe.
- **A sight's page** (`#sightView`, route `#<id>`): the camera flies there, the hero steps aside and the words sit low over a soft shade, so the sight fills the sky above them: a short line on what it is, its name between two arrows to the previous and the next sight (the list goes round), a few words, a dot for each sight (this one lit), and Nolan's logo back to home. The arrow keys ← → do what the arrows do. On a short screen (a phone on its side) the few words are left out, so they do not cover the sight. Back on home, the list is where you left it.
- **Escape goes back** (`Home.back()`, used by `router.js`): from a sight or Nolan to home, from Notes and Settings to where you came from, from home to the app (a guest stays on home).
- At the top right: just the sky, Notes and Settings.
- In code: `Home.enter(id, go)` flies there and then shows it (`go`), `Home.isSight(id)`, `Home.sights()`, `Home.back()`.

## The astral theme

The whole site lives in the night sky:

- **Sea of stars**: drawn by the 3D universe (see above). Only without WebGL2, `js/sky.js` and `css/sky.css` draw a fixed `#sky` instead: four layers of stars in real star colours (drawn once on canvas and used as tiles), film grain and a vignette, slow drift, twinkling, scroll parallax and shooting stars.
- **Glass** (`css/astral.css`): cards, tab bar and buttons are dark translucent glass with starlight borders and glows; section titles end in a four-point star.
- **Effects** (`js/effects.js`): soft points of light where you tap, sparks and a ring of light when a task is ticked. Stars in the interface are round points of light, never geometric shapes.
- **The sky outside** (`js/weather.js`, on home): weather now, today's high and low, chance of rain and the next sunrise or sunset. Weather from Open-Meteo, place names from BigDataCloud, both free and without keys, saved for 20 minutes.
  - The place is where the device is (the browser asks once, after the PIN); if not allowed, Getafe. If the browser already allows it and nothing is saved yet, that place comes first, not Getafe.
  - Only the newest request may change the card: an older, slower answer (the last place, or Getafe) never overwrites the weather of where the device turned out to be.
  - Before the weather arrives the card already has its full shape ("—" in each figure, dimmed), so nothing on home moves when it comes.
  - Without connection it tries again every 20 minutes (not every minute), and at once when the connection is back. The sun is still computed offline (`js/astro.js`).
  - A guest gets Getafe's weather, without being asked where they are, and nothing is saved.
- **Your constellation** (Tasks): one star per task, lit and joined when done. A new star is born (its small flare) only when you tick a task here, never for ticks that arrive from the cloud.
- **Ticks light up** like stars: a tick pops only when you tick it (class `.just` in `tasks.js`), not when ticks arrive from the cloud or the tab opens again.
- **The red "now" line** ends in a glowing point. Each minute it and the words in the day's header ("quedan 30 min", `#dayLive`) are moved and rewritten in place, so they never fade in again. While home is open, *Today* and Tasks measure nothing (the page behind is not drawn); they catch up when shown.

How much of it runs depends on the Effects setting (High = Animations All + Quality High; Medium = All + Medium; Minimal = None + Low; the table shows every pair, which the code still handles):

| | Quality High | Quality Medium | Quality Low |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Animations All** | everything | glass and glows over a still sky of simple stars; no galaxies, stardust, warp or shooting stars | plain background, no glass or glows; ripple and bursts only |
| **Animations Basic** | the sky stands still; no stardust, warp or shooting stars | the same, still | plain and still |
| **Animations None** | nothing moves | nothing moves | everything off |

In code: `fullMotion()` for decorations that move, `lowMotion()` for any motion, `highQuality()` for heavy visuals, `fancy()` (both) for the showy extras.

## Name and logo

The site is called **Nolan**. The logo is an astral N: four identical four-point stars joined by straight lines, symmetric (green → blue gradient): `favicon.svg` is the source; `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are rendered from it. The same mark sits small in the header (`.brand-mark` in `index.html`).

## What the site has

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Home** (house icon, `#home`; also where the app starts) | First screen: the time, a greeting and a weather card (now, high, low, rain, next sunrise/sunset) for where you are. Further down, where to go: the sections **UC3M** and **Nolan**, and the **sights** of the universe (see *Home*). The UC3M card sums up the week, the class now and the next assessment. Also buttons for just the sky, Notes and Settings. |
| **Sights** (`#earth`, `#moon`, `#blackhole`, `#whirlpool`, `#ringgalaxy`, `#edgeon`, `#orion`, `#pleiades`, `#ring`, `#binary`, `#antennae`, inside home) | The camera flies to each one and frames it whole, with its name, a few words and arrows (or ← →) to the previous and the next. |
| **Schedule** (`#schedule`) | *Today*: the day's classes with their room, the red "now" line and "X min left"; the next 7 days; the week's dates and advice. Below: weekly timetable and monthly planner. |
| **Subjects** (`#subjects`) | One card per subject: timetable and rooms, faculty, grading with a grade calculator, dates, and syllabus with progress. |
| **Exams** (`#exams`) | Everything graded, with filters. Past items are dimmed. |
| **Tasks** (`#tasks`) | Tasks per subject and general ones. Ticks are saved to the cloud. |
| **Faculty** (`#faculty`) | Table with email and office. |
| **Notes for Claude** (`#notes`, inside home) | Free text saved to the cloud. **Claude cannot read JSONBin**: to pass them on, press *Copy notes* and paste into the chat. |
| **Settings** (`#settings`, inside home) | Language (Spanish / English) and **Effects**, one choice for animations and quality together (`LOOKS` in `prefs.js`): High (the living 3D universe: animations all, quality high), Medium (a sky of stars you can fly through: all, medium) and Minimal (a plain background, nothing moves: none, low). Saved on each device. There is only the dark look (the light theme was removed in v0.52). Changing any of them reloads the page through a passage: the screen fades softly (≈0.4 s) to the colour of the empty night sky, not a flat black, the page reloads behind it and the new look fades in (`js/shift.js`). The fades run on the compositor, so the busy start of the page behind cannot make them stutter; while the passage covers the screen completely (`html.shift-dark`) the universe draws nothing but the one frame the passage waits for. The passage opens when the page is ready — the universe built and drawn, the saved data read, the font in — but never waits more than 2.5 s: a galaxy still being built then fades in by itself. At the bottom, the red button: Log out (for a guest: leave guest mode). |
| **Nolan** (`#nolan`) | Under construction. |

On mobile the tabs sit at the bottom and you can swipe between them.
Old Spanish links (`#horario`, `#asignaturas`, `#notas`…) still work, and the old `#soon/andromeda` and `#soon/sombrero` links fly to the ring galaxy and the edge-on galaxy.

## Languages

- The **code** is in English: names, comments, files.
- The **interface** comes in Spanish and English (`js/i18n.js`). Every visible text goes through `t("key", {vars})`:
  - Add a new text to **both** `STRINGS.es` and `STRINGS.en`.
  - A plural is an object `{one, other}`, chosen by `vars.n` (or use `tn(key, n)`).
  - Static texts in `index.html` use `data-i18n` (text), `data-i18n-html`, `data-i18n-aria`, `data-i18n-title` and `data-i18n-placeholder`. The Spanish text is also written in the HTML, so the page reads fine before JavaScript runs.
  - Dates are formatted with `fmtLong`, `fmtShort`, `fmtDayShort`, `fmtDayMonth`, `fmtRange`, `fmtMonthYear`, `dayName` (mid-sentence form) and `termOrdinal`.
- The **data** (`data.js`, `eval.js`) stays in Spanish: it is copied from UC3M documents. Its keys are English.
- A missing translation falls back to Spanish and is listed in the `#debug` panel. The tests fail if any key is missing.

## File map

Each file does one thing. To change something you usually only need one or two.

### Data (what changes most)

| File | Contains |
|---|---|
| `data.js` | Subjects (`SUBJECTS`), timetable (`CLASSES`), faculty (`FACULTY`), graded dates (`EVENTS`), terms (`TERMS`), academic calendar (`CALENDAR`), weekly advice (`ADVICE`) and tasks (`TASKS`, `GENERAL_TASKS`). |
| `eval.js` | Grading and syllabus of each subject (`GRADING`). |
| `config.js` | JSONBin key for saving to the cloud. Without it the site works but does not save. |

### Code (`js/`), in load order

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `prefs.js` | Settings (`SETTINGS`, `saveSetting`) and `lowMotion()` / `fullMotion()` / `highQuality()` / `fancy()`. |
| `i18n.js` | Spanish and English texts (`t`, `tn`) and date formatting. |
| `core.js` | Shared helpers: dates, weeks, term in force, classes on a day (`classesOn`), event labels (`eventLabel`, `whenLabel`), detail panel, error banner. |
| `shift.js` | The passage (a soft fade) when a setting reloads the page. |
| `gate.js` | The entry screen: Nolan's logo, which opens the PIN keypad, and the Guest button; guest mode (`Gate.guest()`); Log out / leave guest mode (`Gate.lock()`); `Gate.onOpen` for what must wait for the way in. |
| `wonders.js` | The other wonders drawn by the 3D universe: nebulae, the Pleiades, a feeding binary, the Antennae, supernovae, the Earth and the Moon. Each declares the sights it is (where, how big). They register themselves in `window.UNIVERSE_EXTRAS`, so it loads before `universe.js`. |
| `universe.js` | The 3D universe (WebGL2): galaxies on exact orbits, their dust and light, the far sky, shooting stars and comets, the camera flights, the sights (`PLACES`, `sightView()`), and its slow life. |
| `sky.js` | A simpler CSS sky, only for devices without WebGL2, and the sky of stars of Effects = Medium (`window.Stars`). |
| `validate.js` | Checks `data.js` and `eval.js` before rendering. Whatever would break the page is left out and reported at the top; odd things go to the console and `#debug`. |
| `derived.js` | Computed data: clashes between classes (added to `EVENTS`) and the timetable grid layout. |
| `cloud.js` | Saving to JSONBin, by changes, queued and without overwriting anything; read only after the PIN, never for a guest (see *The cloud*). |
| `header.js` | Clock, date, week and figures, and the compact header: scrolled down, the tab bar (computer) keeps the logo = home, the time, Aula Global, Notes and Settings; on a phone the header shrinks to one row with the time. It is the only clock: it emits the `minute` and `newDay` events. |
| `astro.js` | The real sky, offline: sunrise and sunset, the Moon's phase (for the Moon, its sight and its words), the meteor shower going on (more shooting stars). |
| `weather.js` | Weather and sun on home: only the newest answer counts, a card of the same size while it waits; for a guest, Getafe's weather, not kept. |
| `schedule.js` | Weekly timetable (grid and list by day) and the clash status bar. |
| `today.js` | The *Today* viewer (the red line and `#dayLive` are moved in place each minute). |
| `subjects.js` | Subject cards and grade calculator (`subjectCard`, `recalc`). |
| `faculty.js` · `exams.js` · `tasks.js` · `notes.js` · `planner.js` · `settings.js` | One tab, page or block each. |
| `nolan.js` | **The Nolan section.** Everything new for Nolan goes here. |
| `home.js` | The home window: the hero, the section cards (UC3M / Nolan), the list of sights (`SIGHTS`) and each sight's page with its arrows; Notes and Settings open inside it. |
| `router.js` | Routes (`#schedule`, `#home`, `#nolan/…`, the sights; old `#soon/…` links go to the galaxies they were), tabs, the swipe gesture and the Escape key (back). It keeps a guest on home, its sights and Settings, and shows the page once it has chosen the first view (`data-booting`). |
| `view.js` | Just the sky: hides the interface to enjoy the universe. |
| `sw.js` (root) | The offline copy: a service worker (see *Offline*). |
| `debug.js` | `#debug` panel with screen measurements, data warnings and missing translations. |
| `effects.js` | Ripple and stardust on tap, star burst on ticking a task, warp on changing tab, and *idle* (decorations pause after 45 s without touching anything). |

### Design (`css/`)

`base` · `sky` · `header` · `tabbar` · `today` · `schedule` · `planner` · `subjects` · `exams` · `tasks` · `home` · `nolan` · `settings` · `effects` · `astral` · `cinema`.
Each one has its own mobile tweaks at the end.

- **Colours** are tokens on `:root` in `base.css` (`--space`, `--paper`, `--card`, `--card-solid`, `--ink`, `--ink-2`, `--rule`, `--go`, `--warn`…). Use them instead of fixed colours. `--card` is see-through glass; use `--card-solid` where nothing may show through.
- **Animations setting**: `<html data-motion="full|basic|none">`. `basic` stops the decorations that move on their own; `none` stops everything (`effects.css`, section 13). In JavaScript, check `fullMotion()` for decorations and `lowMotion()` for everything else.
- **The marks on `<html>`** set by the `<head>` script of `index.html` before painting: `data-locked` (the entry screen; `cinema.css` hides the rest), `data-guest` (a guest), `data-booting` (nothing of the page shows until `router.js` has chosen the first view, so the first frame is never the wrong page; if a script fails it shows anyway after 3 s). `universe.js` adds `gl` or `nogl`.

## How to add things

**A graded date** → `data.js`, list `EVENTS`:

```js
{subject:"ed", date:"2026-11-13", what:"Segundo parcial: bloque 2", weight:"25 %", type:"ex",
 time:"09:00–10:30", room:"Aula 2.2.C04", format:"Presencial y escrito", syllabus:"Temas 5 y 6"}
```

- `type`: `ex` exam · `en` submission · `cl` class or lab · `cf` clash.
- The week and the date label ("vie 13 nov") are computed.
- If **the day is unknown**: use that week's Saturday and `noDay:1`. It shows as "semana N". A custom text can go in `label`.
- If it **lasts several days** (an online test open Monday to Saturday): `until:"2026-10-31"`. The planner joins the first and last day with a line.
- If it is **online**: `online:1`, so there is no warning that there is no class that day.
- It shows up by itself in the subject card, *Today*, the planner, *Exams* and the week.

**A class** → `data.js`, list `CLASSES`:

```js
{subject:"ec", day:3, start:840, end:930, kind:"laboratorio", room:"INF 7.0.J04", when:"24 sep · 22 oct", group:"82",
 dates:["2026-09-24","2026-10-22"]}
```

- `day`: 0 = Monday … 4 = Friday.
- `start`/`end`: minutes since midnight (840 = 14:00).
- A weekly class has `from`/`to`; a class on loose dates has `dates`.
- Half width, hatching for loose dates and clashes are computed.

**A task** → `TASKS.<subject>` or `GENERAL_TASKS`: `["Title","Detail"]`.
Each tick is tied to the title, so tasks can be removed or reordered without moving the others.

**Advice for a week** → `ADVICE[term][week]`.
Advice only: that week's dates are added on top automatically.

**Term 2**:

1. New entries in `SUBJECTS` with `term:2`.
2. Their classes in `CLASSES`, grading in `GRADING` and faculty in `FACULTY`.
3. Optionally, advice in `ADVICE[2]`.

From 26 January the site shows those subjects by itself; syllabus progress, the header figures and the label change too. Until they are added, term 1 keeps showing.

**A new setting** → add its values to `SETTINGS_DEFAULTS` and `SETTINGS_OPTIONS` (`prefs.js`), a row in `ROWS` (`settings.js`) and its texts (`s.set.*` in `i18n.js`). Animations and quality are still two settings underneath (`SETTINGS.motion`, `SETTINGS.quality`, read by the rest of the code), but Settings only offers them together, as the levels of `LOOKS`.

**A new section** → see *To add a section* in *The universe*.

**A new wonder in the sky** → `js/wonders.js`: `skyWonder("id",{at:{d:[x,y],m:[x,y]}, z, R, rot, blend:"add"|"over", sight, vis, shader, uniforms})`. `at` is where it sits seen from home (share of half the screen, computer and phone), `z` how far, `R` its radius in space; `sight` its name as a sight and `vis` how much of its square it really fills (see *To add a sight*). The shader gets `vQ` (−1…1 across the sprite), `uT` time, `uA` fade and `uS` a seed, plus `fbm`/`h12` from universe.js. Something that does not sit still writes its own `{id, shaders, layout(api), draw(api, phase, t, now), sights}` and pushes it to `window.UNIVERSE_EXTRAS` (see the supernova, and the Earth and the Moon); multiply its fade by `api.appear(x)` so it fades in once its program is ready. A shader that does not compile is left out with a warning; the rest of the universe goes on. Add it to the list in the wonders test.

**A new sight** → see *To add a sight* in *The universe*.

**Nolan** → `js/nolan.js` (content) and `css/nolan.css` (design). Sub-pages work: `#nolan/anything` reaches `Nolan.render(box, "anything")`.

## Code rules

- **No libraries, no build.** Each file in `js/` is a plain script. Anything declared at the top level with `const` or `function` in one file is visible from the next ones.
- **An error in one file does not take the others down.** A red banner at the top also shows the file and the message.
- **Events** (`document.addEventListener`):
  - `minute`: the minute changes.
  - `newDay`: the day changes; `detail` is the date.
  - `tab`: a tab opens; `detail` is its name.
  - `cloud`: the saving status changes; `detail` is `{kind, text}`.
- **Dates** are `"YYYY-MM-DD"` strings. To work with them use `fromISO` (noon, safe from daylight-saving changes) and `addDays`.
- **What changes every minute is updated in place**, only where something changed (the text of home, the red line, the weather card): rebuilding it would restart its animations and make it flicker.
- **Style**: English, comments that explain *why*, nothing written by hand if it can be computed from the data.

## Offline

The site works without a connection (`sw.js`, a service worker, registered at the end of `index.html` when the site is served over the web):

- **The page** comes from the network first, so a new version is seen as soon as there is signal; without signal, from the copy kept on the device. It is asked of the server itself, not of the browser's own cache (`cache:"no-cache"`), which could keep an old page for minutes.
- **Its files** (css, js, data, icons) carry the version in their address (`?v=…`), so the kept copy is always right and they load instantly.
- **What to keep is read from `index.html` itself** (every `href` and `src`, plus the manifest's icons): nothing to list by hand. Each fresh `index.html` drops the files of older versions and fetches the new ones, so only one version is ever kept. Publishing a version needs nothing extra.
- **Your data**: `cloud.js` keeps the last copy read on the device, so ticks, grades and notes show offline; changes made offline are kept on the device too and go up when the connection is back, even after closing the app.
- The weather keeps its last reading, and sunrise and sunset are computed offline.
- Installable: add it to the home screen (`manifest.webmanifest`) and it opens like an app, with or without signal.

## The cloud

`cloud.js` saves to JSONBin the task ticks (`hechas`), the exam grades (`grades`) and the notes for Claude (`notas`). Those record keys stay in Spanish on purpose: renaming them would lose what is already saved.

- **It is read only after the PIN** (`Gate.onOpen`), and never for a guest: nothing of yours is asked for behind the entry screen.
- **The copy kept on this device shows at once**, while the fresh one is read: your ticks, grades and notes are there from the start, and the fresh read only changes what did change. Listeners get `(rec, {copy:true})` for that copy (`Cloud.onLoad((rec, info)=>…)`). The notes show that copy at once, but you can type in them only once the fresh read has arrived.
- Nothing is written until the first read succeeds. It retries by itself and your changes wait in a queue.
- It saves **by changes** ("this task done", "this grade") on top of a fresh read, so it never overwrites what you did not touch.
- When the app is hidden or closed, pending changes are flushed. When you come back after a while, it reads again.

Settings are not in the cloud: they are per device (`localStorage`, key `settings`).

## Publishing a version

1. Versions are numbered 0.49, 0.50…; the current one is **0.70**. Bump the number in `index.html`: the footer (`v0.70`) and every `?v=0.70` of the code files, all at once. If the logo changes, also bump the `?v=` of the icons in `index.html` and `manifest.webmanifest`: browsers keep favicons cached for a long time and only fetch them again when the URL changes.
2. Upload the changed files to GitHub, keeping the `js/` and `css/` folders.
3. GitHub Pages takes a minute or two. The footer number tells you which version you are seeing.

## Tests

```
node tests/run.js
```

Needs Node and Playwright. 115 checks in a real browser, 119 with the PIN (see below). They never reach the real cloud or the real weather (`config.js` may hold real keys): JSONBin, Open-Meteo and BigDataCloud are cut off in every test, unless the test puts a fake of its own in front.

**The PIN is not in the tests either** (the repository is public). The checks that type it read it from the environment:

```
NOLAN_PIN=<the PIN> node tests/run.js                  (Git Bash, macOS, Linux)
$env:NOLAN_PIN="<the PIN>"; node tests/run.js          (PowerShell)
```

Without `NOLAN_PIN` those three checks are skipped and say so (the flight after the right PIN, the device remembered, the PIN landing at home after Log out); every other check runs, with the device already remembered, as after a right PIN. With it there is one more check: that `NOLAN_PIN` really is the PIN (its hash is the one in `gate.js`), so a wrong one is never typed as if it were right.

- the page loads without errors, nothing is wider than a phone, and it shows once the first view is chosen (`data-booting` gone);
- the entry screen: at first only the logo and the Guest button, nothing read from the cloud behind it, the logo (or a digit typed on a keyboard) opens the keypad, a wrong PIN, the remembered device, the PIN nowhere in the page (without `NOLAN_PIN`: no run of six digits in the page has the PIN's hash), Log out; with `NOLAN_PIN`, also the flight into home and the next PIN landing at home;
- starting at home, the camera flights (UC3M, the second click, back home), Notes opened from UC3M without leaving its galaxy, a sight's card, its arrows and the arrow keys, Escape from a sight back home, the old `#soon/…` links flying to their galaxies, and Notes and Settings inside home (and tappable on a phone over a sight);
- **the sights**: every sight is flown to and framed whole, in the middle and above its words, on four screens (a computer, two phones and a phone on its side); the black hole in home's sky and up close; the Earth far behind home, filling the middle with the Moon beside it, and the black hole (a speck from there) not traced over it;
- **guest mode**: no UC3M, Nolan or Notes, nothing read from the cloud, Getafe's weather without the device's location and not kept, every page of the app sending back home, still a guest after reloading, and the way out in Settings;
- **no flicker**: the red line moves in place (a new minute never fades it in again), home's cards do not blink when the opening ends, the weather card keeps its size when the weather arrives, and ticks do not pop (nor stars get born) when the cloud answers, while a tick of your own pops and its star is born;
- the tabs, and old Spanish links;
- the red line at different times, the minute change and midnight;
- dates without a day and multi-day windows (and the line that joins them in the planner);
- the cloud, with a simulated JSONBin: a failed or slow first read, migration of old ticks, and this device's copy on screen before the cloud answers (notes read-only until then);
- grades with a comma;
- the home window: it blocks the page behind (which is not drawn at all meanwhile), Escape back to the same tab, its first screen is only the hero and the sections and the eleven sights come when you scroll (the arrow takes you there); just the sky; Nolan;
- settings: no light theme, the passage when a setting reloads the page, English after reloading, every text translated in both languages (every sight's words too), English dates, and the animation levels;
- the astral layer: weather and sun on home, the five galaxies and their three companions built (UC3M the golden barred spiral low on the left, home the blue spiral), the Moon's phase and the meteor showers (checked against known dates), the band of our galaxy, the seven wonders compiled and drawn, a supernova, the Earth at the opening, Quality = Low and Medium (the sky of stars, flying into UC3M's star), the three Effects levels and the tasks constellation;
- the compact header when scrolled;
- the swipe gesture;
- idle;
- offline: the site opens without a connection, and a task ticked offline survives reopening and is saved once online.

Add a test whenever you fix a bug.

## Roadmap

Ordered by how much it will be noticed.

1. **Final exam dates.** The official windows are 16–22 December and 11–25 January. The days are missing; add them to `EVENTS` as soon as they are out.
2. **Syllabus of each exam** (`syllabus` in `EVENTS`). It already shows in the detail panel when present.
3. **Term 2.** The structure is ready: only the data is missing (see above).
4. **Nolan.** Decide what it is and build it in `nolan.js`.
5. **Exams in the phone's calendar.** An "Add to my calendar" button that generates an `.ics` with all `EVENTS`, so the phone itself gives reminders.
6. **Term average.** With the calculator grades and the ECTS, the weighted average and what each final needs.
7. **Fixed Madrid time**, even when the phone is in another time zone (travel).
8. **Tests on GitHub.** Run `tests/run.js` with GitHub Actions on every upload.
